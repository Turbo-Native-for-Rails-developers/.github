Hi, I'm Joe, the [Turbo Native guy](https://masilotti.com)! ðŸ‘‹

This organization manages the code for my upcoming book, _Turbo Native for Rails developers_.

Iâ€™m opening up access to beta readers soon. These folks will get early access to the book (for a discounted price) in exchange for detailed feedback.
